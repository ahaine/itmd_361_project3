	    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <h3>Video Games & Streaming</h3>
	    <p>Everyone has their own hobbies that they enjoy.  For some, that might be baseball, football, fishing, or drawing.  If those hobbies are not on your list, I aplogize.  The hobbies I listed are the only examples I could think of.</p>
	    <p>For me, I enjoy videogames, music, and streaming!<p>
	    <p>I might of caught you off guard or confused you when I said streaming.. Let me explain.  I recently developed my own brand and started streaming myself playing video games.  I do not get many viewers, but money is not the goal.  I just ike the idea of creating funny live streams and hanging out with other people who love video games.  My love for video games started at a young age.  The very first game I remember playing is Pokemon Yellow for the Gameboy Color.  I grew up on Nintendo games and eventually switched over to PC.  One of my favorite games to this day is Super Smash Bros for the N64 Console.</p>
	    <p>Sorry, I went off on a tangent.  That is what happens when you love something so much and you can't withold your excitement.</p>
	    <p>My name for streaming and making livestreams is Stilladogg101.  I picked this name because this was the first name that my brother and I came up with when I first made an online account to play with people over the internet.  Not only that, but I love dogs.  As you can guess from my logo, I love German Shepherds.</p>
	    <p>The picture below is my logo for Stilladogg101.  This is a picture from when I first paid to have someone make the concept for my logo idea.</p>
	    <img src="Media/slogo.media" alt="stream logo">
	    <p>I can not wait until I am able to start streaming again.  I also want to start making Youtube videos aswell.  I am not sure what Youtube videos I will create, but I know the subject.  Let me know if you are a fellow gamer outside.  I would love to meet more people who are interested in this stuff.  Not only video games, but streaming too.</p>
	    <p>Oh, before I forget.  For those who do not know what Super Smash Bros is, here is a video of the game on Nintendo 64.  Super Smash Bros is a multiplayer fighting game where you fight against your favorite Nintendo Characters.</p>

	    <h3>Music</h3>
		<section id="right1">
		  <p> High School Band: </p>
		</section>
	    <p>One of my other favorite hobbies is listening to music and drumming.  I joined band in middle school and continued band until I graduated high school.  I was a percussionist throughout middle school and high school band.  I joined drumline the firt chance I got as a freshman.  Music has been a part of me for a big chunk of my life.  Drumming and listening to music has helped me get through a lot of struggles in life.</p>
	    <p>I have my own drumset and my own electric drumset.  Unfortunately, I am unable to play either of them.  Both of my sets are at my mom's house in Michigan.  I do not live in a place where I could store them or play them.  Well, I could play the electric drumset, but the normal drumset is too loud.  Playing the drumset loud is the fastest way to get your neighbors to hate you.</p>

		  <p> My Music Taste: </p>
		</section>
		<p>For the most part, I love all genres of music.  To me, genres are like different flavors.  The only genres I have had a hard time getting into is death metal and country music.  I love heavy metal, but for some reason I can't get into death metal.  Here is a list of favorite bands/artists that I like to listen to:</p>
