	    <p>As you can see, this is an image of my goofy face.  I want to take the time and introduce myself to you.  I find it is best to always start off an introduction with some background information.  I live in Chicago land area.  Originally, I am from St.Joseph, Michigan.  I grew up in St. Joseph and graduated high school at the St. Joseph High School.  If you are looking at Michigan on the map, St. Joseph is located at the left-bottom corner of the glove.</p>

		</section>
	    <P>Ater I graduated highschool in 2015, I moved to Glen Ellyn so that I could attend College of Dupage.</p>
	    <p>At College of DuPage, I pursued an associate's degree in culinary arts.  A few years later, once I graduated and got my associate's degree.  I decided I wanted to transfer to Illinois Institute of Technology to study IT management and cyber security and computer forensics.  I am super glad that I made the decision to transfer!</p>
